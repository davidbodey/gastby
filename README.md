### This website was created because I wanted to have a portal for my growing interest in photography.  
### I utilized Gatsby, React, AWS (S3, Cloudfront), Imgix, Bulma, and UIkit to create a website that will display new images whenever I add them to the CDN.
### I will continue to work on this website in my free time.

Some of the possible future features:
* upvote/downvote
* redesign grid to improve appearance
* reorganize images
* remove extraneous images
* add srcset
